# Flask HTML CSS Basic Calculator
This repository houses a simple calculator web app created with Flask, HTML, and CSS. Offering essential arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two user-inputted numbers, the Flask backend handles calculations based on the selected operation, providing results seamlessly to the user interface without page reloads.

Key Features:
Exclusively utilizes Flask, HTML, and CSS.
Provides addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionalities.
Presents a clean UI with two input fields and a select dropdown for operations.
Dynamically displays calculated results on the same page.
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure Flask is installed (pip install Flask).
Run the Flask application and access it via a web browser.
This project serves as a demonstration of a basic calculator using Flask for backend processing and HTML/CSS for the frontend. It showcases the fundamentals of web app development with minimalistic frontend technologies and a Python-based backend.

Note: Further enhancements are possible, including adding complexity to operations, UI improvements, and implementing error handling for edge cases.
